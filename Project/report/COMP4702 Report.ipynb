    "This report is an investigation into the quantitative traits of fruit flies, known scientifically as the species _Drosophila aldrichi_ and _D. buzzatii_. The data, collected in 1994 captures a range of traits of $n = 1731$ flies located on the East coast of Australia. The attached report on the dataset aims to contribute to understanding the factors driving latitudinal variation in size-related traits in the two species, considering both genetic adaptation and phenotypic plasticity in response to environmental conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fruit flies are a pest to many kinds of agriculture. Adult female flies lay their eggs within fruit and vegetable crops leading to their larvae hatching inside. These larvae then proceed to each the fruit from the inside out, causing rotting and thus destroying the crop. (Department of Agriculture, 2023)"

    "With the exception of the two constant-valued columns, `Year_start` and `Year_end`, all features in the `Thorax` dataset were utilised for classification. With this in mind, it is not possible to plot every pairwise combination of the features as a decision boundary as there would simply be too many plots to show and analyse. Instead, using the technique described in the **Ranking of Predictor Variables** section, only the top `\\delta = 5$ variables are considered for their decision boundary. We are interested in the top ranking predictor variables because they are the ones most likely to show a manifold like structure of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "When plotting pairs of variables, the remaining features are held constant at their respective mean. This does have limitations in that some plots may misrepresent the boundaries, particularly if the size of each class isn't equal, however, it allows us to visualise the model in an easy to understand way. \n",
