    "This report is an investigation into the quantitative traits of fruit flies, known scientifically as the species _Drosophila aldrichi_ and _D. buzzatii_. The data, collected in 1994 captures a range of traits of $n = 1731$ flies located on the East coast of Australia. The attached report on the dataset aims to contribute to understanding the factors driving latitudinal variation in size-related traits in the two species, considering both genetic adaptation and phenotypic plasticity in response to environmental conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fruit flies are a pest to many kinds of agriculture. Adult female flies lay their eggs within fruit and vegetable crops leading to their larvae hatching inside. These larvae then proceed to each the fruit from the inside out, causing rotting and thus destroying the crop. (Department of Agriculture, 2023)"

For example, we could say a fly with a higher than average Thorax length also very likely has a higher then average wing loading.\n",

In any analysis it would be a good decision to strip these from the model as they don't provide any additional information for classification purposes."

This report will attempt to develop models which can classify both the **Species** and **Population** of fruit flies given the remaining variables collected. <!--While not covered in the attached report, knowing which species and population a fruit fly in its natural habitat belongs to may be helpful understanding its behaviour-->\n",

    "Secondly, this report will attempt to perform feature selection by first ranking the input variables in descending order of importance. The top important variables will then be sliced from the dataset and used in a second round of classification for each model. Finally, comparisons can then be made between the models trained with all attributes, and models trained with the supposedly redundant attributes removed.\n",
