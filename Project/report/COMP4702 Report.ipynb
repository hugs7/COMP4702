    "This report is an investigation into the quantitative traits of fruit flies, known scientifically as the species _Drosophila aldrichi_ and _D. buzzatii_. The data, collected in 1994 captures a range of traits of $n = 1731$ flies located on the East coast of Australia. The attached report on the dataset aims to contribute to understanding the factors driving latitudinal variation in size-related traits in the two species, considering both genetic adaptation and phenotypic plasticity in response to environmental conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fruit flies are a pest to many kinds of agriculture. Adult female flies lay their eggs within fruit and vegetable crops leading to their larvae hatching inside. These larvae then proceed to each the fruit from the inside out, causing rotting and thus destroying the crop. (Department of Agriculture, 2023)"

    "We note some columns as having no correlation with any other columns, namely `year_start` and `year_end`. Looking at the raw data, we see these are constant for all rows. In any analysis it would be a good decision to strip these from the model as they don't provide any additional information for classification purposes. Additionally, it was observed that there exist only distinct `Latitude` and `Longitude` which are unique for each population. To make the classification fair, it would also make sense to remove these prior to training."

    "## Processing of the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to filtering some of the features out, the data was preprocessed before it was fed to the models. In order of implementation, the following preprocessing steps were performed on the `Thorax and wing traits` dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Randomisation\n",
    "\n",
    "For a handful of the rows of data, some columns were missing values. Given this is fairly insignificant with respect to the $n=1731$ rows in the dataset, any decision would be acceptable here, however, in this case these values were replaced with the mean of the respective column. Replacing with the mean is a logical decision as in theory this should not have an affect the distribution of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test Train Split\n",
    "\n",
    "For all models, a $70$ to $30$ train to test split was performed on the data. However, each model used the data slightly differently, and is further discussed below in the **Models** section of this report.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Normalisation\n",
    "\n",
    "For both non-parametric models, the data was normalised prior to fitting the respective classifier. In the case of $k$-NN, this is an essential step to ensure the distances commputed by the model use the Euclidean distance metric. Hence we want each feature to have (approximately) the same variance such that distances between variables are uniform. and decision tree models, the data was normalised, primarily because normalising does not have any affect on the model's performance. For the decision tree, this is less important, though given this is still a non-parametric learning algorithm, it remains standard practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encoding of non-numeric data\n",
    "\n",
    "For the three columns `Species`, `Population`, and `Sex`, the string values were converted into indices (e.g. $0, 1, 2, ...$) so each model could interpret them. These columns are not normalised since the values take discrete values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### One hot encoding of the outputs for the neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the neural network model the output variables $(y)$ were one-hot encoded. This is discussed more in detail in later sections of this report, but this was primarily done in order to enable the network to produce an output for which a loss can easily be computed. It would not make sense for discrete classes $(0, 1, 2, ...)$ to have different \"losses\" between them simply because the index of the class was further apart vs closer. By one-hot-encoding the output variables, each pair of classes has the same loss magnitude between them unlike numerical data where there should be a metric of loss which is proportional to the \"distance\" between values.\n",
    "\n",
    "OHE also enables multiple variables to be more easily predicted, as these can be outputted in a flattened vector far more easily by a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PCA?\n",
    "\n",
    "Although PCA is discussed heavily in machine learning, it was not performed for this classification task. Primarily, there are already few features ($14$) and so further reducing the dimensionality of the data does not make sense in this case. Furthermore, a consequence of performing PCA is the loss of interpretability. For example when visualising decision boundaries, a single principal component may be comprised of many original variables meaning one cannot say for sure which of those variables contributed to the decision boundary being at a given place on the scale."

    "\n",
    "### Model Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "As two output variables are being predicted, two separate $k$-NN classifiers were constructed, each with equal parameter setups (e.g. train set, test set, cross validation method, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selection of $k$ - Cross Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross validation was performed for each of the two $k$-NN classifiers (one for each output variable). A grid search over a wide range of $k$ values was performed in order to find the optimal value of $k$. To start, a $30\\%$ test set was put aside and kept independent from cross validation. On the remaining $70\\%$, each $k$ from $1$ through $100$ was trained on a randomly selected $\\frac{4}{5}$ of the train set and validated on the remaining $\\frac{1}{5}$. For each $k$, a new slicing into $5$ buckets was performed. The validation allowed us to obtain an accuracy value for each $k$ in the tested range. Once found, a final classifier was trained on a separate test set (not used in cross validation) to obtain the final results. A plot showing the accuracies for the output variable `Species` (from cross validation) of each $k$ is below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"..\\plots\\Thorax_knn_accuracies_Species.png\" width=\"700\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal value of $k$ found was $k = 34$. We observe the accuracy plot, though on a fine scale is not a smooth function. Partially this is due to the dataset being only $n = 1731$ rows which when sliced up into discrete bins used for training reduces the size of each effective training set significantly. Therefore, a small change in $k$ can result in a big change in accuracy as a result of a given train batch being \"lucky\" or \"unlucky\". Nonetheless, this does show a clear maximum on the lower end of the x-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "A plot showing the accuracies for the output variable `Population` is shown below. Note the same range of $k$ was tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"..\\plots\\Thorax_knn_accuracies_Population.png\" width=\"700\">\n",
    "\n",
    "We see from this graph that the optimal value of $k$ was slightly higher at $k = 39$. Both these values of $k$ are quite high which indicates there is likely significant overlap of the data. In other words, the model performs better when it can \"see\" points further away from the test point rather than a smaller neighbourhood."

    "\n",
    "The decision tree model had a similar setup to $k$-NN, however without cross validation being used. Again, two decision tree classifiers were trained since there were two output variables. Due to the small number of features ($14$), the only hyperparameter of the max tree height was chosen at $h_{\\text{max}} = 10$.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the decision tree was utilised for determining the importance of variables or predictors in the dataset. This was done independently for each of the two output variables. When training a decision tree, a ranking of the variables is naturally provided by the `sklearn` library. The importance of a feature is calculated based on the total reduction of the criterion (e.g., Gini impurity) brought by that feature. For each feature, `scikit-learn` under the hood sums up the reduction in impurity for all the nodes where the feature is used to split the data. These feature scores are then normalised providing a vector of relative feature importances as an output.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other methods of determining variable importance, including for example Generalised Cross Validation (GCV) which essentially computes the reduction in the GCV metric as each variables is added into the classifier. The value of GCV is derived from leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) error and can be calculated with the following formula. It's value can be compared as features are removed (or added) to the model in order to obtain a relative ranking between them.\n",

    "- $y_i$ is the observed or true target value (class) for the $i$-th data point.\n",
    "- $\\hat{f}_\\theta^{(-i)}$ is the model's prediction for the $i$-th data point when that data point is omitted (i.e. LOOCV)\n",
    "- $\\hat{h}_i$ is a measure of influence of the $i$-th data point in the model. For example it could be distance from the mean for each variable \n",
    "\n",
    "... however, this is fairly complex to implement and there isn't an existing function within a (common) library such as `sklearn` or `scikit-learn` like there exists in R under the `caret` package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence when training both the $k$-NN and neural network models, the decision tree was trained on the same data first, not for it's performance, but instead to obtain a ranking of predictor variables. This was then used in order to determine which decision boundary plots to show, given that plotting all of them would be infeasible and difficult to understand. Note the ranking of predictor variables is independent between the two output variables."

A workaround is to pad the one-hot-encodings to be the same length between variables. \n",

A very low value was chosen here because we are already very limited for the number of features $14$ inputted into the model.

    "During training of each classifier a total of $14$ predictor variables were fed as inputs for training. While this is by no means a high number of input variables, it would be impractical to plot every pairwise combination of the features as a decision boundary as there would simply be too many plots to show and analyse. We note that decision boundary plots can only really be shown in 2 dimensions (at least for now or without AR!). Instead, using the technique described in the **Ranking of Predictor Variables** section, only the top $\\delta = 4$ variables were considered for their decision boundary. We are interested in the top ranking predictor variables because they are the ones most likely to show a manifold like structure of the data.\n",

From the plots below we can clearly see the regions of the classes learned by the model with respect to specific variables. Using a dimensionality reduction technique does not make sense here given the already small number of features. In the case of hundreds or thousands of input variables where many of them turn to be important, then PCA could be considered useful, however, it was not used in this report for the reasons specified above.\n",

    "As expected for a parametric model, the neural netork learned a far smoother function than the non-parametric counterparts. This is indicated by the continuous decision boundary in the bottom-right plot (`Temperature` vs `wing loading`). Looking at the overlayed test points, this boundary appears to be the only one showing a clear difference between the two species. On the left we see more `D._buzzatti` and on the right we see more `D._aldrichi`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrast this with the plots involving `l2` and `w2` where it appears `D._aldrichi` is contained within `D._buzzatti` having the same or similar mean but a smaller variance. Unlike the decision tree model, the neural network is limited to a the constraints of a parametric function as a decision boundary. This does appear to hurt performance of the model with the NN achieving a train accuracy (averaged over the final $20,000$ epochs) of $44.4\\%$ and a test accuracy of $42.6\\%$. A plot showing the train and validation accuracies during training is show below.\n",

    "\n",
    "While this accuracy is quite low, it is evident from the decision boundary plots above that the two species do not show a clear difference in any of the features other than perhaps `wing loading` and `temperature`. This explains the poor accuracy, though it is good to see here that the generalisation gap between train and test is quite small, indicating the model has not overfitted to the train data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in the data preprocessing section, if `Longitude` and `Lattitude` were included in the features, $X$, the model achieved over $90\\%$ train and $85\\%$ test accuracy, which corroborates the finding that these features were fixed for each class within the `Population`."

    "From the array of decision boundary plots above, it is evident the final $k$-NN model for predicting `Population` saw a similar output compared with the `Species` final $k$-NN mode. We see again that `Thorax Length` and `wing_loading` were the two best predictors as evident by the fact the decision regions have boundaries only with respect to these features. However, there are many more populations (5) than species (2), and hence the plot appears far more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final model achieved a train accuracy of $30.6\\%$ and a test accuracy of $18.9\\%$. This is much lower than the `Species` $k$-NN classifier, which can partially be explained by the fact that there are simply more classes a given test point could be. Choosing randomly a classifier has a $50\\%$ chance of a correct answer for the `Species` prediction, which drops to just $20\\%$ when predicting `Population`. Hence one should be careful when comparing these figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the plots, namely of `wing loading` vs `w1` and `wing loading` vs `w2` may appear interesting at first, given the low accuracy, it can be concluded the model did not actually perform well at distinguishing between different populations, primarily due to too much overlap of the classes. We do see different regions of classes within the plot, and these are for the most part uniquely separated, however, these could perhaps be due to slightly higher clusters of a class that simply happen to be present in that area of the hyperspace compared with the other classes. So while a high value of $k$ does limit overfitting, it may also hide the fact the model isn't understanding the distribution of the data."

This further illustrates the sharp, orthogonal decision boundaries of a decision tree.

Contrary to the numbers, given the analysis above in this report, it can be concluded both of the non-parametric models struggled to capture structure in the data. While non-parametric models are more flexible in what they can identify, they are also deceving in that they appear to identify clusters that in reality aren't actually there. The generalisation gap for $k$-NN wasn't so bad, as a high $k$-value was used during training, but the decision tree model which lacked a grid search cross validation for its max depth suffered significantly here, especially with predicting `Population`. \n",

    "In conclusion this report into classifying `Species` and `Population` from the Thorax & wing traits dataset revealed that classifying these features is extremely difficult given the data available. It highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of three fundamentally different models. The $k$-NN and decision tree models were able to achieve fair results in this setting, however, the neural network model perhaps showed a better understanding of the underlying structure in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "The high value of $k$ for classifying both `Species` and `Population` as selected by cross validation does make sense here, though as discussed, it does hide the fact that these supposed clusters of classes may actually not be so accurate, particularly when there are lots of classes. Hence it may be a good idea to train a final classifier also on lower values of $k$ to see the results of the decision boundary plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision tree model did achieve a high train accuracy, however, it's test accuracy in classifying both `Species` and `Population` (notably the latter) was much lower. This indicates the model was potentially overfitted to the data. In future, performing cross validation to obtain an optimal max tree depth via a grid search may be a good step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the decision tree's high performance in classifying species would benefit from further investigation, perhaps using bagging (e.g. a Random Forest) to corroborate this finding, as it does not appear clear from the visualisations presented that the model captured the underlying distribution of the species data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, given the difficulty of this classification task, combining the other two datasets with the `Thorax and wing traits` as used would be an interesting extension to this report. It could perhaps investigate if adding additional features to the training set helps (or doesn't help) to increase performance of the different models."
